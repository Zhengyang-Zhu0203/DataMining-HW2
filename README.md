# DataMining-HW2

The CodeHW2 folder contains all the code files required for the second homework. These codes are written according to the homework requirements and are used to perform key operations such as data processing, model training, and analysis calculations to support the answers to the relevant questions in the homework and the generation of results. The code is written following common programming norms and best practices, ensuring a certain degree of readability and maintainability. You can run these codes according to your actual needs to regenerate the analysis results, or delve into the code logic to further understand the data processing flow and algorithm implementation behind the homework.

DataMiningHW2.pdf is the core document of this homework, with a total of 7 pages. This document covers detailed answers to all the questions in the homework. The answering process is logical and well - argued, applying the theoretical knowledge and analysis methods of data mining learned. At the same time, the document contains rich visual result analysis. Key information such as data characteristics and model performance is intuitively displayed through carefully crafted charts (such as bar charts, line chartsetc.). These visual results not only assist in answering questions but also help readers quickly understand complex data relationships and analysis conclusions, serving as an important way to deeply understand the results of this homework.
